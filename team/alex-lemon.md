{% include team-profile.html slug="alex-lemon" name="Alex Lemon" title="Content UX and strategy" location="London" bio="<p>Without content, there is no web. So I’m here to make the web a better place by changing the way digital projects consider content. I do a lot of this by asking, ‘Why?’</p>

<p>My job is to understand what users need and want from content, and what businesses want and need to achieve with it. I work closely with all my Convivio teammates to put content at the heart of technical and design decisions, so sites and services create a great user experience.</p>

<p>I’ve worked in writing and content since 2000; digital content for 10 of those years. I’ve been a journalist, so I’m good at probing questions and considering audiences first. I’ve been a chartered accountant, so I’m good at tidy spreadsheets and defying the boredom threshold. I’ve worked in big businesses and small startups, so I hear where everyone’s coming from.</p>

<p>
I run 🎽 and I’m learning Romanian 🇷🇴 <br />
I like etymology 🤓 and emojis 🍋<br />
I believe kindness and understanding make better business🎈 ⚖ 💼</p>

<p><strong>Ask me about:</strong><br />
– why content matters more than visual design<br />
– why my face is on coffee tables worldwide
