{% include team-profile.html slug="mike-bell" name="Mike Bell" title="Senior Developer" location="Manchester" bio="<p>I like building the right solution for the right problem. I take pride in picking the right technical solution to build something that's maintainable and sustainable over the lifetime of a project. I enjoy technical challenges and discovering new ways of doing things.</p>

<p>I’ve worked with a range of great clients like British Council, Greater London Authority, Ministry of Justice and Kew Gardens delivering some really interesting projects.</p>

<p>My passions are coding, gaming, beer, whisky and the Drupal community. I’m co-organiser of NWDUG in Manchester. I love craft beer and am always on the lookout for nice beers in my travels.</p>

<p>If I disappear after a scrum it’s because I’ve gone to make coffee! My favourite brewing method at the moment is inverted Aeropress. I’m passionate about good coffee.</p>
